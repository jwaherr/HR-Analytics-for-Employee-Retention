Jawaher Alhuthayfi

## Abstract 
This project aimed to build a machine learning model with high prediction accuracy to help the HR department in a company to know how likely an employee leaves their company or stays in the company, and recognize the factors that lead a person to leave their current job. The data used in this project is provided by Kaggle, the data of the company has multiple records with different parameters and a two-class classification label that indicates whether the employee left the company or not. A machine learning model will be built to train the dataset to predict whether a certain employee will leave the company or not by employing Logistic Regression using Python (scikit-learn). Also, visualizing the results using seaborn and matplotlib.

## Design
This project is intended for the T5 Data Science BootCamp requirements. Data provided by Kaggle has been used in this project. It consists of company records of different parameters for each employee (such as satisfaction level, salary, number of promotions, department, etc.). Using machine learning algorithms to train from the dataset can help the HR department to classify whoâ€™s at risk of leaving and assist them to pinpoint the main reason. Which is beneficial to avoid the time and financial cost of replacing employees

## Data
The dataset is provided in .csv format. It contains 14,999 records, each record has 10 features. The most important feature of this project is the class label (left) which is indicate if the employee has left the company or not.
