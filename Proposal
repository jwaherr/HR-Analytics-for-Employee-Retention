Abstract 
This project aimed to build a machine learning model with high prediction accuracy to help the HR department in a company to know how likely an employee leaves their company or stays in the company, and recognize the factors that lead a person to leave their current job. The data used in this project is provided by Kaggle, the data of the company has multiple records with different parameters and a two-class classification label that indicates whether the employee left the company or not. A machine learning model will be built to train the dataset to predict whether a certain employee will leave the company or not by employing Logistic Regression using Python (scikit-learn). Also, visualizing the results using seaborn and matplotlib.
